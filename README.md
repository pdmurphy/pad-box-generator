# pad-box-generator

This started as a small project to learn python as well as tackle a unique use case.

This project takes a csv list of the ID numbers of cards from Puzzle & Dragons and create an image that would be similar to my box in Puzzle & Dragons. Due to copyright reasons I am not hosting the images so you have to provide/have the images yourself. Images should be 100x100

There is now also a basic UI version of the project in addition to the CLI version.

Thanks to the Tsubotki team for assistance.
