# pad-box-generator

This is a small project done to learn python as well as tackle a unique personal use case.

Initial ReadME - only basic summary

This project can take a list of the ID numbers of cards from Puzzle & Dragons and create an image that would be similar to my box in Puzzle & Dragons. Due to DMCA reasons I am not hosting the images so you have to provide/have the images yourself.

Thanks to the Tsubotki team for some assistance.
