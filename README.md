# pad-box-generator

This is a small project done to learn python as well as tackle a unique personal use case.

Initial ReadME - only basic summary

with the help of the Tsubotki team, they were able to take my document
https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1paUBgapY2p0fNy5XH7LVByDNWrFRp17YZclWJz1jAzM/edit#gid=1601991606
turn it into a list of IDs

with that list + the images of all icons, this projects aim is to take that information and create an image that would be similar to my box in Puzzle & Dragons
